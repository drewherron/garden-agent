# Garden Agent

I've come up with a new plan for this project and I'm starting over from scratch.

This will be an AI-powered garden assistant where you can:

- Log garden activities in natural language
- Ask for gardening advice powered by a knowledge base
- Query your garden data with natural language
- Get personalized recommendations based on your garden history

- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** for gardening knowledge and advice
- **Vector databases** for semantic plant similarity and knowledge retrieval
- **Named Entity Recognition** to extract plants, dates, and activities from text
- **AI agents** for complex multi-step reasoning and planning
- **Text-to-SQL** for natural language database queries

The end goal is a mobile-friendly web app that works locally with Ollama models (no API costs) and can eventually be distributed as an F-Droid compatible app. I'd like to be able to use this while working out in my garden.

I'll update this README later when the program is more complete.
